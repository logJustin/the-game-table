# Development Session Notes

## Session Summary (2025-08-13)

### Discovery Phase Completed ✅
- Conducted comprehensive app discovery and requirements gathering
- Defined "The Game Table" concept: mobile-first game selection and logging app
- Identified target users: friend groups of 4-6 people for game nights
- Established core features: game spinner selection + session logging
- Chose Roll20-inspired tabletop aesthetic design direction

### Technical Foundation Established ✅
- Created Next.js 15 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Set up Supabase database with complete schema (sessions, games, logs, participants)
- Configured environment variables and deployment-ready setup
- Established Vercel deployment pipeline
- Created comprehensive documentation (Implementation Guide + Setup Guide)

### Architecture Decisions Made ✅
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, Vercel
- **Authentication:** Session-based (no user accounts needed)
- **Real-time:** Supabase subscriptions for live game updates
- **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS with custom Roll20-inspired theming
- **Mobile-First:** Primary focus on mobile/touch experience

### Issues Resolved ✅
- Fixed environment variable loading issues during development
- Cleaned up test artifacts and debugging code
- Established proper project structure and documentation
- Verified database connectivity and build process

## Key Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- `sessions`: Main session tracking with host and status
- `current_games`: Games added to spinner for active session
- `game_logs`: Historical record of completed games
- `session_participants`: Track who joins each session

### User Flow Design
- Friends bookmark main app URL (no separate session links needed)
- Join active sessions by entering name
- Real-time collaborative game selection
- Spin wheel for random game choice
- Log game results and duration

### UI/UX Direction
- **Color Palette:** Burgundy primary, wood/leather tones, brass accents
- **Typography:** Medieval headings (Cinzel), readable serif body (Crimson Text)
- **Components:** Wooden game wheel, leather panels, brass buttons
- **Interactions:** Tactile feedback, realistic physics, mobile gestures

## Outstanding Work & Next Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)
1. **Roll20 UI Implementation** - Set up color system, typography, base layout
2. **Session Management** - Create/join session flows with real-time updates
3. **Game Spinner Component** - Wooden wheel with Canvas-based rendering
4. **Mobile Touch Interactions** - Gesture handling and tactile feedback

### Medium Priority Features
- Game logging forms and winner tracking
- Session history and statistics view
- Retroactive editing capability
- Performance optimizations

### Future Enhancements
- Sound effects and haptic feedback
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- BoardGameGeek integration
- PWA capabilities

## Development Workflow Notes

### Environment Setup
- Environment variables properly configured in `.env.local`
- Supabase database ready with RLS policies configured
- Vercel deployment connected to GitHub repository
- Build process validated and working

### Common Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Development server (usually runs on :3000 or :3001)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Code quality check
```

### Troubleshooting Reference
- **Port conflicts:** Dev server auto-switches to available port
- **Env variables:** Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side access
- **Database issues:** Check Supabase project status and connection strings
- **Build errors:** Verify TypeScript types and imports

### Development Best Practices Established
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Component-based architecture with clear separation
- Real-time features using Supabase subscriptions
- Accessibility considerations built into design system
